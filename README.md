Kubernetes Go types that can be used with [TinyGo](tinygo.org/) to build WebAssembly
modules meant to be run outside of the browser.

The Go models are compatible with TinyGo and can be serialized and deserialized using the JSON format.

## Comparison with the official Kubernetes Go library

TinyGo is an alternative Go compiler that can produce WebAssembly code that is
not targeting the browser. The official Go compiler isn't capable of that yet.
TinyGo is the only option for developers who want to write Go code and
build it into a WebAssembly module meant to be run outside of the browser.

TinyGo doesn't yet support the full Go Standard Library, plus it has limited
support of Go reflection.
Because of that, it is not possible to import the official Kubernetes Go library
from upstream (e.g.: `k8s.io/api/core/v1`).
Importing these official Kubernetes types will result in a compilation failure.

## Requirements

Consuming these types requires **TinyGo 0.28.1 or later.**

> **Warning**
> Using an older version of TinyGo will result in runtime errors due to the limited support for Go reflection.
