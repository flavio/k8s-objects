// AllowedHostPath AllowedHostPath defines the host volume conditions that will be enabled by a policy for pods to use. It requires the path prefix to be defined. Deprecated: use AllowedHostPath from policy API Group instead.

// swagger:model AllowedHostPath
type AllowedHostPath struct {

	// pathPrefix is the path prefix that the host volume must match. It does not support `*`. Trailing slashes are trimmed when validating the path prefix with a host path.
	//
	// Examples: `/foo` would allow `/foo`, `/foo/` and `/foo/bar` `/foo` would not allow `/food` or `/etc/foo`
	PathPrefix string `json:"pathPrefix,omitempty"`

	// when set to true, will allow host volumes matching the pathPrefix only if all volume mounts are readOnly.
