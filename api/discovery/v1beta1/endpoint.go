This includes, but is not limited to the following well known keys: * kubernetes.io/hostname: the value indicates the hostname of the node
	//   where the endpoint is located. This should match the corresponding
	//   node label.
	// * topology.kubernetes.io/zone: the value indicates the zone where the
	//   endpoint is located. This should match the corresponding node label.
	// * topology.kubernetes.io/region: the value indicates the region where the
	//   endpoint is located. This should match the corresponding node label.
